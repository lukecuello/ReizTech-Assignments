# ReizTech-Assignments
## This repository contains my answer to the internship application assignments given to me by ReizTech. Here are the problems given: 

> 1. **Please write console app. User should be able to input hours and minutes of the analogue clock. Program must calculate lesser angle in degrees between hours arrow and minutes arrow and provide output in the console window.**

> 2. **Imagine we have a hierarchical structure:**
>
>
> ![Recursion Tree Class](/images/2.png)  After creating this object, we can add new Branch type objects into branches variable. Doing so we increase object depth by one. Into created objects we can add again new branches etc. In the figure below we have similar structure. This structure depth is 5.
